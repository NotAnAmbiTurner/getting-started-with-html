<h2>HTML: Inline vs Block</h2>
Block elements: create a container, like a paragraph style in .odt (sorta)<br>
Inline elements: modify conents in-line, like a character style in .odt (again sorta)
<h2>The Internet</h2>
Is a series of tubes
<h2>HTML and HTTP</h2>
<p>HTML is the language in which (parts) of webpages are written.<br>
HTTP is the protocol by which HTML documents interact</p>
... <br><br>
I feel like that's basically right?
<h2>Tags</h2>
Tags <em> in <a href="www.bhastings.com">HTML</a> can <b>nest</b>. <br> I wonder if this creates problems or complexity if you accidentally/on purpose </em>nest<em> block tags.</em>
